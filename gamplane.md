### Here’s the Flow in Plain English:

1. **Lowercase everything**
   So casing doesn’t matter anymore.

2. **Create an empty set for the sentence**
   You’ll fill this set with only the valid letters from the sentence.

3. **Loop through the sentence**
   For each character:

   * If it’s between `"a"` and `"z"`, add it to the set.
   * Otherwise skip it.

4. **Now your set has only the unique letters used in the sentence.**
