Great idea! Python is an excellent language for string manipulation. The overall approach will be very similar to what we did in JavaScript, using built-in string and list methods.

Here's an outline you can follow:

1.  **Define the function:** Start by defining a function that takes one argument, the sentence string.
2.  **Split the string:** Use the `split()` method to break the sentence into a list of words.
3.  **Handle multiple spaces:** Similar to JavaScript, you can handle multiple spaces by using `split()` without any arguments, as it will automatically split on any whitespace and handle multiple spaces correctly.
4.  **Reverse the list:** Use a list slicing trick `[::-1]` or the `reversed()` function to reverse the order of the words in the list.
5.  **Join the words:** Use the `join()` method to combine the words back into a single string, with a single space between them.
6.  **Return the new string:** The function should return the final reversed string.

Once you have a draft, I can help you review it and make any necessary adjustments.
