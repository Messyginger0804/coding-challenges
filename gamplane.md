Okay, let's break down how to solve the RGB to Hex problem. The solution has three main parts: extracting the numbers, converting them, and formatting the final string.

### 1. Extracting the Numbers

The first step is to get the `r`, `g`, and `b` values out of the input string like `"rgb(255, 255, 255)"`. The easiest way to do this is with a combination of string manipulation methods:

1.  **Remove the outer parts:** Get rid of the `"rgb("` at the beginning and the `")"` at the end of the string.
2.  **Split the remaining string:** Split the result by the delimiter `", "`. This will give you an array of three strings, each containing a number.
3.  **Convert to numbers:** Finally, convert each of those three strings into a numeric value that you can use for the next step.

### 2. Converting to Hexadecimal

Once you have the three numbers (0-255), you need to convert each one to its hexadecimal equivalent. In most programming languages, there's a built-in method for this.

* The conversion for each number should result in a hexadecimal string.
* The final output needs to be six characters long, so each of your three hex strings must be exactly two characters. If a number's hex value is only one character (like `10` which becomes `a`), you must add a leading zero (`0a`) to meet the two-character requirement.

### 3. Combining and Formatting

The last step is to assemble the final output string:

1.  Take your three two-character hexadecimal strings.
2.  Combine them into a single six-character string.
3.  Make sure any letters in the hex string are lowercase.
4.  Prepend a `#` character to the final result.

This process handles all the requirements of the problem, including the correct format and length.
